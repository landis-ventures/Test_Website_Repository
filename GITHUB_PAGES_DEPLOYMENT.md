# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Overview
This project has been successfully converted from a full-stack application to a static site compatible with GitHub Pages. The `docs/` folder contains all the necessary files for deployment.

## What Changed
- ✅ Contact form now uses email-based submission (opens user's email client)
- ✅ Admin dashboard converted to static informational page
- ✅ All backend dependencies removed from the static build
- ✅ Added 404.html for client-side routing support
- ✅ Built static assets optimized for GitHub Pages

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub Repository
1. Upload all files to your GitHub repository: `landis-ventures/Test_Website_Repository`
2. Ensure the `docs/` folder is included in your repository

### 2. Configure GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Pages**
3. Under "Source", select **"Deploy from a branch"**
4. Choose **"main"** branch and **"/docs"** folder
5. Click **Save**

### 3. Configure Custom Domain (Optional)
If you want to use a custom domain:
1. Edit the `docs/CNAME` file and replace the content with your domain
2. Configure your DNS settings to point to GitHub Pages
3. In GitHub Pages settings, add your custom domain

### 4. Verify Deployment
- Your site will be available at: `https://landis-ventures.github.io/Test_Website_Repository/`
- Or at your custom domain if configured

## Important Notes

### Contact Form Functionality
- The contact form now opens the user's email client with pre-filled information
- This is a common approach for static sites that don't have backend servers
- Alternative: You can integrate with services like Formspree, Netlify Forms, or Typeform

### Database Features
- The admin dashboard is now informational only
- To restore full database functionality, you'd need to deploy the full-stack version on platforms like:
  - Replit (current working version)
  - Vercel with serverless functions
  - Netlify with serverless functions
  - Heroku or similar hosting platforms

### Files Ready for GitHub Pages
- `docs/index.html` - Main entry point
- `docs/404.html` - Fallback for client-side routing
- `docs/assets/` - CSS and JavaScript bundles
- `docs/CNAME` - Domain configuration (optional)

## Troubleshooting

### Site Not Loading
- Check that GitHub Pages is configured to serve from `/docs` folder
- Ensure all files are properly committed and pushed
- Check the repository is public (or you have GitHub Pro for private repo Pages)

### Routing Issues
- The 404.html file handles client-side routing
- If links don't work, ensure GitHub Pages is serving the 404.html properly

### Contact Form Issues
- Email clients not opening: This is normal on some systems/browsers
- Users can manually email: info@landisventures.com
- Consider integrating a form service for better user experience

## Next Steps
Your static site is now ready for GitHub Pages! The migration preserves all the visual design and functionality while making it compatible with static hosting.
